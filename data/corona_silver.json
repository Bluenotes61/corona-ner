Coronaviruses are enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses of mammals and birds. These viruses have high mutation and gene recombination rates, making them ideal for pathogen evolution. 1 In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with mild disease, the common cold. Previous emerging novel coronaviruses, such as SARSCoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, were associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease. MERSCoV was less pathogenic than SARSCoV, with the most severe infections mainly in individuals with underlying illnesses. Clinically and epidemiologically, the contemporary 2019nCoV in China seems to resemble SARSCoV. The genome of 2019nCoV also appears most closely related to SARSCoV and related bat coronaviruses. 2 The infection has now spread widely, with phylogenetic analysis of the emerging viruses suggesting an initial singlelocus zoonotic spillover event in November, 2019, 3 There is an increasing focus on the humananimalenvironment disease interface, as encompassed in the One Health concept. Mortalities, disabilityadjusted lifeyears, and billions of dollars of economic losses from these infections demand action and investment in prevention to face novel challenges to human and animal health. Research has led to better understanding of the nature and drivers of crossspecies viral jumps, but the detail is still elusive. No reservoir population of bats for SARS and MERSCoV or Ebola virus have been definitively identified, despite considerable searching, possibly because of the source virus circulating in small and isolated populations. Forensic examination has clarified the human infection sources and multispecies involvement in these diseases, with some species confirmed as competent hosts (eg, camels for MERSCoV 4 ), bridge (or amplifying) hosts (eg, pigs for Nipah virus, nonhuman primates for Ebola virus 5 ), or deadend hosts. The crucial checkpoint is the jump and bridging of the viruses to humans, which occurs most frequently through animalbased food systems. In the case of SARS, markets with live and dead animals of wild and domestic origins were the crucible for virus evolution and emergence in the human population. Once the viruses' functional proteins enabled cell entry in civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), the bridge was established and it was only a matter of time before the jump to humans occurred. 6 Sequence comparison of civet viruses suggested evolution was ongoing; this was further supported by high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARSCoV among civet sellers, suggesting previous crossspecies transmission events without necessarily humantohuman transmission. 7, 8 Similarly, early Ebola virus was mostly associated with bushmeat and its consumption in Africa; Nipah virus is associated with date palm sap, fruit, and domestic pig farms; MERS is associated with the camel livestock industry; and H5N1 arose from viral evolution in domestic and wild birds, to ultimately bring all these cases to humans.

Furthermore, current evidence strongly suggests that bats are the original source for MERSCoV, as many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to MERSCoV originate in bats, including BatCoVHKU4, BatCoVHKU5 and other MERSrelated coronaviruses [12] [13] [14] [15] . The BatCoVHKU4 was also shown to be able to engage the cellular receptor of MERSCoV, adding evidence to the bat origin theory [16] . However, there has not yet been direct evidence for isolating MERSCoV from bats (reviewed in [10, 11, 17] ).", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus", "start": 60, "end": 77}]}]}, {"paper_id": "1cf54d1c77b7f0494ab971429d26e0e199952d09", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARSCoV2 infection in vitro Jia Liu 1 , Ruiyuan Cao 2 , Mingyue Xu 1,3 , Xi Wang 1 , Huanyu Zhang 1,3 , Hengrui Hu 1,3 , Yufeng Li 1,3 , Zhihong Hu 1 , Wu Zhong 2 and Manli Wang 1 Dear Editor, The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2 2019nCoV) poses a serious threat to global public health and local economies.

At the time of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)coronavirus epidemic in 2012, we had highlighted the absence of diagnosis of this virus among travellers returning from the Hajj pilgrimage, which contrasted with the considerable anxiety relating to this emerging infection and its risk of importation and spread in mainland France [2] . Instead of MERSCoV, influenza A and B viruses had been detected. This illustrated the major disconnect between the fear of a hypothetical spread in France of a virus emerging in the Middle East and the reality of the absence of diagnosed cases, while concomitantly the very real and high incidence of respiratory viruses common worldwide and in our country and their associated mortality appeared largely neglected. Seven years later, the emergence of SARSCoV2 in December 2019 reproduced this pattern of disproportionate fear of importation and spread of infections in mainland France while the cases reported worldwide remain almost only localised in China as only 34 people died of this disease (Covid19) outside China as at 25 February 2020 [3] .", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus 2019", "start": 130, "end": 152}, {"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "start": 169, "end": 216}]}]}, {"paper_id": "3650b941642ddc9c3627fdb8d415f8c8b69a4158", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARSCoV) that spread in 2003 and 2004 from the Guangdong province of southern China to 32 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America, resulting in over 8,000 cases and 774 deaths [1, 2] .

The discovery of the SARS coronavirus (SARSCoV) as the etiological agent for SARS was a major breakthrough [1] , which was quickly followed by the successful sequencing of the whole genome of the virus [2, 3] . Genome sequence comparison between this new coronavirus and the three known classes of coronavirus revealed a similar genome structure, but minimum homology at the amino acid level, strongly suggesting that the SARSCoV was a new class of coronavirus [2, 3, 4] . A comparative sequence analysis of 14 SARS isolates from different countries suggested a moderate genetic diversity among the SARS isolates and thus implied a slow evolution of the SARSCoV genome [5] . Furthermore, sequence variation analyses of SARSCoV isolates demonstrated that common genetic variations in the SARSCoV genome could be used as ''molecular fingerprints'' to partition the viral isolates into different genetic lineages, track the transmission of a specific viral lineage, and infer the origin of infection [5, 6] .

Excluding the polyadenylated tail at the 3'terminus, the genome of RoBatCoV GCCDC1 was 30,129 nt in length with a G C content of 45.4%. Comparative genomic sequence analysis indicated that RoBatCoV GCCDC1 was most closely related to RoBatCoV HKU9 strains [18] with 66.6% 67.4% nucleotide identities.

Homologous recombination events frequently occur during the viral RNA replication of coronaviruses, and are important for their evolution [10, [27] [28] [29] . However, it is also possible that coronaviruses are one of the few virus families that can experience heterologous recombination. For example, members of betacoronavirus group A possess an HE gene [30, 31] which was seemingly derived from ancestral influenza C virus, a negativestranded RNA virus with a segmented genome [30, 31] , and which would represent another case of interfamily recombination, although it has also been proposed that the HE gene might be captured from host RNA [32] .

The importance of viruses as major causes of ALRI is becoming increasingly apparent because the sensitivity of detection techniques has greatly improved and new molecular tests increasingly replace conventional methods. The use of polymerasechain reaction (PCR) now allows identification of viruses that have previously been difficult or impossible to culture. In the past decade, numerous novel respiratory viruses that can cause ALRI have been discovered, and new diagnostic methods for the use in high and lowresource settings alike are continuously evolving (3, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . It seems that the conventional diagnostic methods have systematically underestimated the role of viruses as causal pathogens in ALRI (3) , and also that viruses are capable of causing severe, lifethreatening ALRI (3) . The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus, and the avian influenza type A (H5N1) outbreak are good recent examples (16,20). Impressive progress has been made in the last decade in increasing the global availability of vaccines against the main bacterial causes of ALRI S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B leading to marked reductions in both hospitalizations and deaths (21, 22) . This will lead to increased focus on viral causes and their prevention and management. Strains of influenza type A and B viruses can be life threatening (3) , although infection in the majority of young children is vaccinepreventable (23, 24) . Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are the most common cause of croup in young children, with PIV1 and PIV3 also being the causes of severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia (3, 4, 25) , but there are currently no licensed PIV vaccines.

Coronaviruses (CV) cause common cold and have been historically thought to be a very rare cause of ALRI (32) , despite the fact that they sporadically caused catastrophic disease in livestock (33) . The SARSCV outbreak in 2003, which was a highly virulent zoonosis capable of humantohuman transmission, renewed the interest in CV as human pathogens (32) .

However, this can sometimes be misleading because the results of phylogenetic analysis using different genes or characters can be different. When SARSrCoV was first discovered, it was proposed that it constituted a fourth group of coronavirus [26, 27] . However, analyses of the aminoterminal domain of S of SARSrCoV revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of the consensus sequence for Betacoronavirus [28] . On the other hand, only five of the cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of the consensus sequences in Alphacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus [28] . Furthermore, subsequent phylogenetic analysis using both complete genome sequence and proteomic approaches, it was concluded that SARSrCoV is probably an early splitoff from the Betacoronavirus lineage [1] , and SARSrCoV was subsequently classified as Betacoronavirus subgroup B and the historical Betacoronavirus as Betacoronavirus subgroup A. Therefore, the phylogenetic position of a coronavirus is best appreciated and confirmed by constructing phylogenetic trees using different genes in the coronavirus genome. The most commonly used genes along the coronavirus genome for phylogenetic studies include chymotrypsinlike protease, Pol ( Figure 2) , helicase, S and N, because these genes are present in all coronavirus genomes and are of significant length. The envelope and membrane genes, although present in all coronavirus genomes, are too short for phylogenetic studies. It is noteworthy that the cluster formed by the three novel avian coronaviruses BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12 and MunCoV HKU13, which was originated proposed as group 3c [2] , might represent a new coronavirus genus provisionally designated Deltacoronavirus (Figure 2 ). Using this approach of multiple gene phylogenetic studies, unique phylogeny of individual gene that may have biological significance may be discovered. During our phylogenetic study on RhBatCoV HKU2, another coronavirus that has was also found in the stool samples of Chinese horseshoe bats, its unique S protein phylogenetically distinct from the rest of the genome was discovered [15] . The S protein of RhBatCoV HKU2 is the shortest among S proteins of all coronaviruses and had less than 30% amino acid identities to those of all known coronaviruses, in contrast to other genes that showed higher amino acid identities to the corresponding genes in other members of Alphacoronavirus. When the S protein of RhBatCoV HKU2 is aligned with those of other members of Alphacoronavirus, many of the amino acid residues conserved among and specific to Alphacoronavirus were not found. Rather, the S protein of RhBatCoV HKU2 shares the two conserved regions of deletions both of 14 amino acids among members of Betacoronavirus in its Cterminus, suggesting that this segment of the S protein of RhBatCoV HKU2 may have coevolved with the corresponding regions in Betacoronavirus. Most interestingly, a short peptide of 15 amino acids in the S protein of RhBatCoV HKU2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the RBM in the S1 domain of SARSrCoV. A similar peptide was also observed in SARSrRhBatCoV, but not in any other known coronaviruses. These suggested that there is a common evolutionary origin in the S protein of SARSrCoV, SARSrRhBatCoV and RhBatCoV HKU2, and RhBatCoV HKU2 might have acquired its unique S protein from a yet unidentified coronavirus through recombination.", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "new coronavirus", "start": 1895, "end": 1910}]}]}, {"paper_id": "4395141eef1089f1c75a14912fade412fd694c19", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Coronaviruses have a broad range of vertebrate hosts and usually cause mild respiratory diseases in humans and animals [1] [2] [3] .

SARSCoV also encodes for eight unique proteins, called accessory proteins, with no known homologues.

During a survey to establish the causes of canine infectious respiratory disease in a large rehoming kennel in the United Kingdom, a CRCoV was isolated in tracheal and lung samples in dogs with mild clinical symptoms. The virus showed a close relationship to the betacoronavirus in the polymerase and S genes, with the highest amino acid identity with the corresponding BCoV proteins and proved to be only distantly related to enteric CCoVs. By sequence comparison of cDNA polymerase in the analyzed 251 bp sequence, the identity was 98.8% for BCoV and 98.4% for HCoV polymerase gene, whereas it was only 68.5% for CCoV, strain 171. When comparing the amino acid sequence obtained by translation of the cDNA sequence from CRCoV to the amino acid sequence of BCoV, HCoVOC43, and enteric CCoV spike proteins in an overlap of 1093 amino acids, the identities were 96%, 95.2%, and 21.2%, respectively ( Figure 3) .

Two out of them emerged in the past 15 years (Lau & Chan, 2015) , namely, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERSCoV). SARSCoV emerged in 2003 in China and spread to many countries throughout the world (Peiris et al., 2003) . Approximately 8,000 people were infected, and 10% of them died (Aronin & Sadigh, 2004) . Only 9 years later, MERSCoV emerged in Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012) . This is a relatively short period for the emergence of a new coronavirus. One of the main reasons behind the rapid emergence of new coronaviruses is the poor proofreading capability of their RNA polymerases (Hofer, 2013) . This is in addition to the possibility of the recombination of different coronaviruses (Makino et al., 1986) , and it will not be surprising if new coronaviruses emerge in the near future. MERSCoV continues to pose great challenges to the healthcare system of some countries in the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula.

The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.

This illustrated the major disconnect between the fear of a hypothetical spread in France of a virus emerging in the Middle East and the reality of the absence of diagnosed cases, while concomitantly the very real and high incidence of respiratory viruses common worldwide and in our country and their associated mortality appeared largely neglected.

SARScoronavirus (SARSCoV), a novel coronavirus classified as a member of the Coronaviridae family was soon identified as the causative pathogen [3, 4] . The RNA genome of SARSCoV consists of 14 potential major open reading frames that encode the viral nonstructural proteins, accesory proteins, and structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [5] . Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the type I integral transmembrane protein, was identified to be the functional receptor for SARSCoV both in vitro [5, 6] and in vivo [7] . Studies on the expression of ACE2 protein and the tissue tropism and cellular distributions of SARSCoV provided new insight into the mechanism of pathogenesis [8] . Nevertheless, certain ACE2expressing endothelial cells and human intestinal cell lines failed to be infected by SARSCoV [9, 10] . In contrast, cells without a detectable expression level of ACE2 such as hepatocytes could be infected by SARSCoV [8] . In addition, the presence of ACE2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection [8] . Altogether, these observations indicate that different virus receptors or coreceptors may be utilized in the infection of SARSCoV in various tissues. Indeed, DCSIGN, a ctype lectin receptor expressed on dendritic cells, and a DCSIGNrelated molecule, LSIGN (also named DCSIGNR and CD209L) have been indicated to interact with the SARSCoV spike protein and to facilitate the virus dissemination [11, 12] .", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus", "start": 458, "end": 475}]}]}, {"paper_id": "63af0d8b639b0abe14d9be9eaa3a135bb9a9eaf1", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Scientists then isolated a novel coronavirus from human airway epithelial cells, which was named 2019nCoV 5 .

After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R t . In the first assumption, R t was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R t = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R t was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R t = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R t = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan.

Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China.

PED was first described in 1971 in United Kingdom, affecting fattening pigs [2] , and the etiological agent was identified in Belgium as a new coronavirus, which was designated as PED virus (PEDV) [3] . PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, and order Nidovirales. PEDV genome consists of 28 kb long singlestranded RNA with positive polarity and includes seven known open reading frames (ORFs). Two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, occupying twothirds of the genome, encode two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) that direct genome replication and transcription. The remaining onethird of the genome encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and one hypothetical accessory protein encoded by the ORF3 gene [4] . Of all viral proteins, the PEDV S protein has a pivotal function regulating interactions with specific hostcell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry [5] . Therefore, PEDV S protein has been often used to understand the genetic relationships between different PEDV strains and the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field (reviewed in [4] ). Other genes including ORF3, E, M, or N have been also utilized for phylogenetic inference [6] [7] [8] [9] and some studies have included PEDV full genome sequences to get better phylogenetic resolution [10, 11] . However, realistically, sequencing the full genome of PEDV is still expensive, from both computational and laboratory perspectives. Moreover, for many computationally intensive analyses, utilizing the full genome is unfeasible. It would be, therefore, beneficial to use only those genomic regions that contain the highest phylogenetic signal to reduce cost without losing valuable information [12] . In fact, phylogenetic markers together 2 BioMed Research International with powerful Bayesian phylogenetic approaches have been successfully applied to track the origin of important viral outbreaks [13, 14] and establish molecular epidemiology links among different viral strains including coronavirus members [15] .

These findings suggest that NCoV is most likely to have arisen from bat viruses. However, a number of pertinent questions remain unanswered: Does NCoV represent an interspecies jump of a bat coronavirus? How did humans acquired the infection? Was it a direct infection from bats to humans or did it involve an intermediate host such as domestic animals? Are the virus isolates from all infected persons genetically identical? Do NCoV genetic variants exits in the human population, but cause mild or asymptomatic infections? Future studies will no doubt attempt to address these and other related questions.

Is the cancer field ready for a moonshot? Perhaps. In the 4 decades since Nixon's war on cancer, there has been tremendous progress in our understanding of cancer, including the discovery of oncogenes, cellular growth factors, and mutations associated with carcinogenesis. Although cancer remains a major killer throughout the world, the death rates for a number of major cancers, including gastric, breast, uterine, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, are actually declining (16) , while average survival times have improved. Even if a cure is not forthcoming, the risk of shooting for the Moon is low. Earlier moonshots have produced benefits that could not possibly have been envisaged when the projects began. The Manhattan Project generated a vast amount of spinoff information that found its way into civilian nuclear power, radioisotopes for medical use, and plutoniumbased batteries for exploratory spacecraft. The space program of the 1960s improved weather forecasting through satellite observation and greatly enhanced telecommunication, and it gave us the global positioning system that empowers our cell phones. Successes in HIV treatment showed that it was possible to effectively treat chronic viral infections, and today the same technology is being applied to many different viruses, some of which cause cancer. The human genome project of the 1990s led to the development of rapid sequencing technologies that have brought molecular biology into routine clinical use, including the use of sequence information to guide cancer therapy. Although Nixon's war on cancer failed to deliver a cure in the 1970s, that effort improved our understanding of the molecular causes of cancer, which is now bearing fruit in the form of new drugs. The efforts to contain SARS provided new information about coronaviruses, and that experience is now being applied to a new coronavirus threat known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS (17) .

Compared to other members of Merbecovirus, EaHedCoV HKU31 possessed unique nonstructural proteins and putative cleavage sites at ORF1ab. Phylogenetic analysis showed that EaHedCoV HKU31 and BetaCoV Erinaceus VMC DEU 2012 were closely related to NeoCoV and BatCoV PREDICT from African bats in the spike region, suggesting that the latter bat viruses have arisen from recombination between CoVs from hedgehogs and bats. The predicted HKU31 receptorbinding domain (RBD) possessed only one out of 12 critical amino acid residues for binding to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), the MERSCoV receptor. The structural modeling of the HKU31RBDhDPP4 binding interphase compared to that of MERSCoV and Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (TyBatCoV HKU4) suggested that HKU31RBD is unlikely to bind to hDPP4.

The coronaviruses of relevant veterinary species are shown in Table 1 with organ affected and clinical signs. Though human CoVs were identified for the first time in the year 1960 from respiratory infections in adults as well as children, the major scientific interest in CoVs research grew only after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARSCoV) in the year 2002 (Drosten et al. 2003 Ksiazek et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003) . In this SARSCoV epidemic, around 8000 confirmed human cases with 774 deaths (around 9.5% mortality rate) occurred that was a result of its global spread (Kahn and McIntosh 2005) . Initially, the virus was detected in the caged Himalayan palm civets and these were thought to be the natural host of this virus . Following SARSCoV incidence in 2003, a similar CoV named HKU31 to HKU33 were identified in the horseshoe bats (noncaged) in 2005 from Hong Kong (Lau et al. 2005) . Since then, bats are considered to be the natural host and potential reservoir species that could be held responsible for any future CoVs epidemics and or pandemics (Cui et al. 2019 . After the 2003 and 2005 SARSCoV epidemics, an analogous virus emerged in the Middle East region of the world leading to severe respiratory illness and was named the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERSCoV) (Zaki et al. 2012 ). The mortality was higher than previous SARSCoV pandemic claiming around 919 lives out of the total 2521 human cases (around 35% mortality) (World Health Organization 2015) .

The hydrophobic region forms at least one amphipathic ahelix that oligomerizes to form an ionconductive pore in membranes [11] [12] [13] . E protein is present within virions in very small amounts, however it is abundant in the infected cells [14] , and it is mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), where it actively participates in virus budding, morphogenesis and trafficking [15] [16] [17] . Interestingly, SARSCoV lacking the E protein was attenuated in different animal models, such as hamsters, transgenic mice that expressed the SARSCoV receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and conventional mice using a mouse adapted SARSCoV [18] [19] [20] [21] , indicating that SARSCoV E gene may be a virulence factor.

A report from a recent workshop in Riyadh on countermeasures for MERS CoV bringing together funders, public health experts and researchers concluded that progress with vaccine development is still hindered by the lack of animal models for evaluating efficacy. 100 Small animals do not naturally express a functional form of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor; however, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 are susceptible to infection. 101, 102 Despite this advance, mouse models are likely to be less useful for the assessment of immune correlates than larger animal models such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets, which exhibit the severe clinical syndromes observed in humans. 103, 104 MVA and ChAd viral vectors for MERS have reached GMP manufacture, while a DNA vaccine is now being tested in clinical trials. 105, 106 Progress with development of chimpanzee adenovirus vectors for outbreak pathogens In May 2017, the first cases in an outbreak of EVD were reported in the Bas Uele Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). 107 This area shares a border with the Central African Republic and is particularly remote and difficult to access.

Maintaining the current momentum for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens is crucial, and as such, simian adenoviruses are uniquely fit for purpose as an effective vaccine platform, not in small part due to their predictable safety profile, stability, manufacturability, but most importantly owing to their immunogenicity.

As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratoryconfirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARSCoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travelrelated cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that humantohuman transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is humantohuman transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARSCoV or MERSCoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines.

According to the ICTV criteria, only the strains found in Rhinolophus bats in European countries, Southeast Asian countries and China are SARSrCoV variants. Those from Hipposideros bats in Africa are less closely related to SARSCoV and should be classified as a new coronavirus species 54 . These data indicate that SARSrCoVs have wide geographical spread and might have been prevalent in bats for a very long time. A 5year longitudinal study revealed the coexistence of highly diverse SARSrCoVs in bat populations in one cave of Yunnan province, China 18, 20, 55 . This location is a diversity hot spot, and the SARSrCoVs in this location contain all the genetic diversity found in other locations of China. Furthermore, the viral strains that exist in this one location contain all genetic elements that are needed to form SARSCoV (FIg. 5) . As no direct progenitor of SARSCoV was found in bat populations despite 15 years of searching and as RNA recombination is frequent within coronaviruses 56 , it is highly likely that SARSCoV newly emerged through recombination of Coronaviruses form enveloped and spherical particles of 100160 nm in diameter. They contain a positivesense, singlestranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of 2732 kb in size. The 5'terminal twothirds of the genome encodes a polyprotein, pp1ab, which is further cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins that are involved in genome transcription and replication. The 3' terminus encodes structural proteins, including envelope glycoproteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In addition to the genes encoding structural proteins, there are accessory genes that are speciesspecific and dispensable for virus replication. Here, we compare prototypical and representative strains of four coronavirus genera: feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) strains GD02 and SZ3 from humans infected during the early phase of the SARS epidemic and from civets, respectively , SARSCoV strain hTor02 from humans infected during the middle and late phases of the SARS epidemic, bat SARSrelated coronavirus (SARSrCoV) strain WIV1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and bulbul coronavirus HKU11.", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "new coronavirus", "start": 1419, "end": 1434}]}]}, {"paper_id": "8f9eda12b9470bd15725025244000aeb69b9ebb7", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Plasmids encoding Vpu, EBOVGP and HIV1 p55Gag were previously described [27, 32] . Expression plasmids for the coding sequences of VSV nucleoprotein (VSVN), phosphoprotein (VSVP), matrix protein (VSVM), glycoprotein (VSVG) and RNAdependent RNApolymerase (VSVL) were generated by amplifying the respective open reading frame (ORF) from a plasmidencoded VSV antigenome (Indiana strain, kindly provided by G. Zimmer) and inserting them via standard cloning procedures into plasmids pCAGGS (VSVN, VSVP, VSVM (mutant ncp, harboring four amino acid substitutions associated with reduced cytotoxicity [33] ) and VSVL) or pCG1 (VSVG). This was achieved by overlapextension PCR technique using primers that introduce the desired nucleotide exchanges. Generation of VSVG mutants A133R and LXXXL was achieved by the same strategy using the expression plasmid for wt VSVG as a template. The expression plasmid for human tetherin was generated by amplifying the ORF from a previously described plasmid [34] and inserting it into plasmid pCAGGS using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. Similarly, porcine tetherin was PCR amplified and cloned via EcoRI and NheI restriction sites. For detection of human tetherin expression, the sequence for a cMyc antigenic tag was added to the 5' end of human tetherin using PCR. In order to generate transgenic cells stably expressing human tetherin, the genetic information for human tetherin was cloned into the retroviral vector pQCXIPmcs, a modified form of pQCXIP (Clontech, Palo Alto), in which the multiple cloning site was modified to contain sites for NotIBamHIAgeIHpaIMluIXhoINruIEcoRI. To generate recombinant VSV that expresses eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein), we constructed a plasmidencoded VSV antigenome (GenBank: J02428.1) with an additional transcription unit for eGFP between VSVG and VSVL ORFs. First, unique MluI and NheI restriction sites were introduced upstream and downstream of the ORF for VSVG, respectively. Next, a cassette consisting of the coding sequences of VSVG and eGFP, separated by a minimal intergenic region [35] was cloned and inserted into the parental VSV genome making use of MluI and NheI restriction sites, thereby replacing the genetic information of VSVG and thus generating VSV \u00c3 (the asterisk stands for eGFP). For convenient exchange of VSVG or eGFP ORFs by other transcription units, unique AscI and NotI restriction sites were added upstream and downstream of the VSVG and eGFP ORFs, respectively. In order to generate VSV \u00c3 mutant VSVG (LXXXL), the respective ORF was amplified from the corresponding VSVG (LXXXL) expression plasmids with primers adding 5' MluI and 3' AscI restriction sites and inserted into VSV \u00c3 , thereby replacing the parental ORF coding for wt VSVG.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARSCoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERSCoV) are coronaviruses capable of infecting humans resulting in a clinical disease of respiratory and gastrointestinal systems [123] . In animal reservoirs, coronavirus infection can result in respiratory, neurological or hepatic disease [124] . Since 2003, numerous novel coronavirus species have been isolated. Within the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera, nine of the 18 recognised viral species have been identified in bats [125] . Moreover, two high profile human disease outbreaks, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been phylogenetically linked to a zoonotic viral origin in bats [126, 127] . Most coronaviruses are associated with insectivorous bats (Rhinolophus sinicus, Rhinolophus macrotis, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Chaerephon plicata, Rhinolophus pusillus, Rhinolophus blasii, Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus, Neoromica capensis, Vespertilio superans) [126] . Battohuman transmission of coronaviruses is likely very rare, if it occurs at all, and it is more common for bats to infect another terrestrial animal which subsequently infects humans. After the discovery and characterisation of SARSCoV circulating in masked palm civets sold at Chinese markets and then later in horseshoe bat populations (Rhinolophus) in China, it was suggested that bats were the primary reservoir and the civet infection was a result of a spill over event [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] . In addition to this, the initial detection of MERSCoV in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia suggested that camelids may be a reservoir host for this pathogen but subsequent studies have reported a single isolation from fecal matter from a Taphozous perforates bat and a \u03b2coronavirus, with 96.5% amino acid identity to the MERSCoV, has been isolated from a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat [127, 133] . This warrants the speculation that either the MERSCoV reservoir resides in a bat species and remains to be discovered, or that dromedary camels are the primary reservoir for MERSCoV that originated following cross species transmission of a viral ancestor that once resided in a bat populations. The coronvirus surfacelocated trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) dictates the coronavirus host range as it specifically binds certain receptors for infection [134, 135] and so studies surrounding receptor utilisation are warranted in determining any host restriction for these viruses. Rhinolophid bats in China have been described as hosts to many SARSlike coronaviruses, some of which are proposed to be the direct ancestors of SARSCoV [136] . Each of these pathogens has the potential to cross the species barrier and cause disease outbreaks in terrestrial species, a process though to be driven by adaptation to the new host through genetic mutation [137] . Whilst many of the exact mechanisms required for a spill over event to occur are largely undefined, the S protein and host receptors are the logical starting point and key binding sites of the S protein and potential host receptors remain to be characterised for multiple pathogens. Certainly, identification of receptor binding domains may reveal host tropism patterns and enable evaluation of virus spill over potential.", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus", "start": 479, "end": 496}]}]}, {"paper_id": "9484a7c6359d1364cd37bb1d80bdefd118d7ffe6", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Enveloped animal viruses also use a twostep process to release their genetic material into the cell: first they bind to specific cellsurface receptors anchored to the target cell membrane and then they induce fusion of the viral and cell membranes.

Detailed knowledge of virusreceptor interactions is essential to understand different aspects that determine viral tropism, spread and pathogenesis. During the last few years, a large number of highresolution structures of viral proteins in complex with their specific receptors have been reported, shedding light on these aspects. Very recently, Wang and coworkers characterized the interactions between the newly identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and its target cell by solving the structure of the receptorbinding domain of the viral envelope spike glycoprotein bound to its cellular receptor, the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 .

HCoVs are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, cause up to onethird of all common colds [7, 8] , and can also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, in susceptible individuals [9] [10] [11] . There are 4 genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. In the genus Alphacoronavirus, there are several species including HCoV229E and HCoVNL63.

Applying the principles of infection control brought the epidemic under control but a concern for reemergence naturally or a deliberate release supported continuation of a vaccine development effort so as to have the knowledge and capability necessary for preparing and using an effective vaccine should a need arise. For this purpose, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases supported preparation of vaccines for evaluation for potential use in humans.

Collectrin was first identified as an unknown protein upregulated in a model of partial nephrectomy, its function remaining elusive for four years until crystals of tyrosine and phenylalanine were detected in the urine of collectrinnull mice [74] . Further investigation revealed that the levels of the neutral amino acid transporter, B 0 AT1, which reached the plasma membrane were significantly decreased in collectrinnull mice [75] . This suggested that collectrin may act as a molecular chaperone for B 0 AT1 in the kidney, implicating ACE2 in a similar role, because of their close homology. An elegant set of studies subsequently revealed that ACE2 did in fact act as the molecular chaperone for B 0 AT1 in the small intestine, where collectrin is not expressed. This interaction was shown to underlie the pathology of the aminoaciduria seen in Hartnup disorder. Hartnup disorder is caused by a mutation on the outer edge of B 0 AT1 resulting in its failure to reach the plasma membrane [76] . It was revealed that this mutation disrupts the ACE2 B 0 AT1 complex and therefore prevents ACE2 from acting as a molecular chaperone delivering the transporter to the intestinal brush border membrane. Outside the cardiovascular system another noncatalytic function of ACE2 had previously been shown. In 2003 a new disease termed \"severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\" caused by a novel coronavirus (SARSCoV) spread quickly around the world, causing more than 800 deaths. ACE2 was identified as the receptor for SARS virus in vitro [77, 78] and also acts as receptor for the NL63 virus. Soon after, studies confirmed that ACE2 was essential for SARS infection in vivo using ACE2knockout mice [79] . Concurrently it was discovered that ACE2 protects murine lungs from severe acute injury [80] and subsequently that SARSCoV infections and the SARS spike protein itself downregulate ACE2 expression (Figure 3) [81].", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus", "start": 1641, "end": 1658}]}]}, {"paper_id": "994021cbe306f8833d4124d53771d0038d248860", "paragraphs": [{"text": "In September 2012, a novel coronavirus was isolated from two cases of acute severe respiratory illness who had traveled to or resided in Saudi Arabia (13, 14) .

In 2012, a novel coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), was discovered in humans and dromedary camels, although genetic evidence supports a bat ancestor. This range of animal hosts lead them to hypothesize that MERSCoV can readily adapt to new hosts. The receptor for MERSCoV, DPP4, has previously been shown to act as a species barrier. By passing the virus over time on cells stably expressing the common vampire bat DPP4 receptor, which MERSCoV binds to inefficiently, they aimed to determine how potential adaptation in the spike glycoprotein may influence species tropism. They showed that observed adaptations that arise in the viral spike protein at residues 465 and 510 after extended replication in cells expressing the bat DPP4 receptor. Protein structures that model electrostatic potential across the surface were used to facilitate preliminary analysis of the adapted MERSCoV Spike variants.

A novel coronavirus was identified as the aetiological agent of SARS [1] . Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this novel SARS coronavirus (SARSCoV) showed that the viral genome is nearly 30 kb in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) [2] [3] [4] . These viral proteins can be broadly classified into 3 groups; (i) the replicase 1a 1b gene products which are important for viral replication, (ii) the structural proteins, spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E), which have homologues in all known coronaviruses, and are important for viral assembly, and (iii) the \"accessory\" proteins that are specifically encoded by SARSCoV. Much progress have been made in characterizing these SARSCoV proteins [5, 6] , but the molecular determinant for the severe clinical manifestations of SARSCoV infection in contrast to the mild diseases caused by most coronaviruses, remains to be determined.

These methods are useful for detecting novel coronaviruses not only in humans, but also in animals for identification of animal reservoir or intermediate host of 2019nCoV. WHO recommended that if there is no clue about the putative pathogen from the pneumonia outbreak, a pancoronavirus assay should be used for amplification followed by sequencing of the amplicon for characterization and confirmation (https:  apps.who.int iris bitstream  handle 10665 330374 WHO2019nCoVlaboratory2020.1eng.pdf). By aligning 2019nCoV S protein sequence with those of SARSCoV and several batSLCoVs, we predicted that the cleavage site for generating S1 and S2 subunits is located at R694 S695 ( Figure 1 ). S1 subunit contains two functional domains, the Nterminal domain (NTD) and a receptorbinding domain (RBD), both of which are responsible for the binding of the virion to the receptor on the host cell. They also contain several conformational neutralizing epitopes, serving as a target for developing neutralizing antibodies and vaccines [5] . S2 subunit contains three functional domains, fusion peptide (FP), and heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2. After binding of RBD in S1 to the receptor, the S2 subunit changes conformation by inserting the FP into the host cell membrane and association between HR1 and HR2 to form sixhelical bundle (6HB), resulting in the fusion between viral and cellular membranes. The viral genetic materials enter into the host cell through the fusion pore for replication in the cell [5] . A peptide derived from the HR2 domain of SARSCoV S protein (SC1) can interact with HR1 region in viral S protein to form heterologous 6HB, resulting in the inhibition of homologous 6HB formation between HR1 and HR2 domains in viral S protein and thus blocking the viral fusion with the host cell [6] . Since 2019nCoV SHR2 sequence is 100% identical to that of SARSCoV, while there are only a few mutations of noncritical amino acids in SHR1 region, SC1 peptide is expected to be also effective against 2019nCoV infection.", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus", "start": 33, "end": 50}]}]}, {"paper_id": "aa973f2833829b97ebdfd6ce2ac6a29b9100db3a", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 as a novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory disease. 1 Since then, this virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula and has spread, occasionally, to other parts of the world. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] According to the World Health Organization, 1626 laboratoryconfirmed cases were reported between September 2012 and 7 January 7 2016 with 586 related deaths in 26 countries. 10 In particular, 186 people were infected and 36 were killed in one recent outbreak in South Korea. 10 MERSCoV is classified into lineage C of Betacoronavirus and is most phylogenetically related to two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5, providing insight on its evolutionary origin. 11, 12 MERSCoV is a polycistronic positivesense singlestranded RNA virus with a genome of~30 Kb in size. The 5\u2032 most twothirds of MERSCoV genome encodes polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are further cleaved to yield 16 nonstructural proteins, whereas the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes several structural or lineagespecific proteins. 13 Upon infection, these proteins are expressed to facilitate viral replication and propagation in the host. 14 MERSCoV infection has been widely reported to mildly induce type I interferons (IFNs), including IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2, in patients as well as in animal and cellular infection models. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This has been attributed to the IFNantagonizing property of some MERSCoVencoded proteins, which directly perturb the host IFN production mechanisms, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] lending support to the notion that MERSCoV uses multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response.", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus", "start": 115, "end": 132}]}]}, {"paper_id": "ab23c1ed37392d4e2dbbd809e62171775e75369b", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Patients with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARSCoV), developed mild to fatal pulmonary disease, with a mortality incidence of 10% [17] .

Virus could be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate and feces for as long as 21 days after disease onset [19, 21] . Delayed virus clearance may have resulted from suboptimal T and B cell responses; suboptimal neutralizing antibody responses are detected in patients with severe disease [17, 18, 19, 20] . Numerous studies demonstrated that SARSCoV infection fails to activate macrophages and dendritic cells. Although these cells can be infected, they are functionally impaired: antiviral cytokines such as type I interferon were not expressed and endocytic capacity (antigen capture) was compromised ( [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and reviewed in [29] ). These unusual findings raised the possibility that initial infection with the virus resulted in delayed or suboptimal activation of the innate immune system.

Specifically, BALB c mice infected with mouseadapted SARSCoV develop severe respiratory disease. Here, we show that the T cell response is defective in these mice and that this results from inefficient activation of the initial immune response to the virus. This defect can be corrected by several treatments, including depletion of inhibitory macrophages from the lungs and direct activation of respiratory dendritic cells, important in initiating the immune response or transfer of activated dendritic cells prior to infection. All of these modalities result in improved initiation of the immune response and an enhanced antivirus T cell response.

The cell tropism and cellular receptor of the six types of coronaviruses are not similar (Additional file 7: Table S1 ). Though at first it was thought that SARSCoV and MERSCoV are structurally similar and tried to treat MERSCoV infected patient with the SASRCoV treatment. But it was found that they bind to two different receptors, namely ACE2 and DPP4 or CD26 respectively [36] . These viruses are actually zoonotic origin, undergo recombination, and may be in future another strain of this group of virus will come [37] . Therefore, it is important to take preventing measures not only to prevent this new strain of coronavirus, also against all the strain of coronavirus. There is no recommended vaccine for coronaviruses which is necessary to prevent. Most of the cases, vaccines were designed by targeting spike protein. Similarly, researchers also reported to design vaccine against SARSCoV and MERSCoV spike protein [38, 39] . Fernando et al. also designed livedattenuated MERS coronavirus by mutating MERSCoV envelope protein as a vaccine which will be for only MERSCoV [40] . These vaccines would thus be effective for only those strains not for others. Giving a universal vaccine for all strain of viruses is much more promising solution rather than giving individual vaccine for individual strain. The concept of prevention of viruses by designing a universal vaccine has also been reported previously, for example against Influenza virus. In case of influenza virus, universal vaccine against matrix 2 protein which was found to be conserved among all Influenza subtypes was reported [41] .

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses of mammals and birds. These viruses have high mutation and gene recombination rates, making them ideal for pathogen evolution. 1 In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with mild disease, the common cold. Previous emerging novel coronaviruses, such as SARSCoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, were associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease. MERSCoV was less pathogenic than SARSCoV, with the most severe infections mainly in individuals with underlying illnesses. Clinically and epidemiologically, the contemporary 2019nCoV in China seems to resemble SARSCoV. The genome of 2019nCoV also appears most closely related to SARSCoV and related bat coronaviruses. 2 The infection has now spread widely, with phylogenetic analysis of the emerging viruses suggesting an initial singlelocus zoonotic spillover event in November, 2019, 3 There is an increasing focus on the humananimalenvironment disease interface, as encompassed in the One Health concept. Mortalities, disabilityadjusted lifeyears, and billions of dollars of economic losses from these infections demand action and investment in prevention to face novel challenges to human and animal health. Research has led to better understanding of the nature and drivers of crossspecies viral jumps, but the detail is still elusive. No reservoir population of bats for SARS and MERSCoV or Ebola virus have been definitively identified, despite considerable searching, possibly because of the source virus circulating in small and isolated populations. Forensic examination has clarified the human infection sources and multispecies involvement in these diseases, with some species confirmed as competent hosts (eg, camels for MERSCoV 4 ), bridge (or amplifying) hosts (eg, pigs for Nipah virus, nonhuman primates for Ebola virus 5 ), or deadend hosts. The crucial checkpoint is the jump and bridging of the viruses to humans, which occurs most frequently through animalbased food systems. In the case of SARS, markets with live and dead animals of wild and domestic origins were the crucible for virus evolution and emergence in the human population. Once the viruses' functional proteins enabled cell entry in civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), the bridge was established and it was only a matter of time before the jump to humans occurred. 6 Sequence comparison of civet viruses suggested evolution was ongoing; this was further supported by high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARSCoV among civet sellers, suggesting previous crossspecies transmission events without necessarily humantohuman transmission. 7, 8 Similarly, early Ebola virus was mostly associated with bushmeat and its consumption in Africa; Nipah virus is associated with date palm sap, fruit, and domestic pig farms; MERS is associated with the camel livestock industry; and H5N1 arose from viral evolution in domestic and wild birds, to ultimately bring all these cases to humans.

Several of the viruses carrying s2m are important animal pathogens, and the conserved nature of the motif might make it an adequate target for antivirals. s2m has so far only been identified in viruses with a poly(A)tailed genome, and always located within 200 nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. In the novel pigeon astroviruses, s2m was located entirely within the 39 UTR ( Figure 5 ), similarly to the location of s2m in all avastroviruses, except for Duck astrovirus (DAstV), where s2m is partially located in the capsid region and partially in the 39 UTR, as in mamastrorviruses. S2m in picornaand coronaviruses is located entirely within the 39 UTR, while s2m in norovirus is located partially in the minor capsid complex (ORF3) and partially in the 39 UTR. The invariant positioning of s2m close to the 39 end of the positive RNA strand may suggest that its function is connected to the replication or the stability of the viral RNA molecule.

Even considering the wide range of host cell types, it might have a function based on interaction with conserved cellular biomolecules.

A pair of PCR primers was designed to amplify the intervening sequences between the two conserved regions, and a fragment that possessed 89% identity over 37 amino acids to MHV, a murine coronavirus, was obtained ( Figure 1 ; sequence available as Data S1, found at http:  dx.doi.org 10.1371  journal.pbio.0000002.sd001.). In a parallel approach, we directly recovered hybridized viral sequences from the surface of the microarray. This procedure took advantage of the physical separation achieved during microarray hybridization, which effectively purified the viral nucleic acid from other nucleic acid species present in the sample. Using a tungsten needle, the DNA microarray spot corresponding to the conserved 39 UTR motif was repeatedly scraped and the hybridized nucleic acid was recovered. This material was subsequently amplified, cloned, and sequenced ( Figure 2 ). The largest clone spanned almost 1.1 kb; this fragment encompassed the 39 UTR conserved motif and extended into the most 39 coding region of the viral genome.

As analysis of the SARSCoV genetic sequence revealed large differences to any other currently known coronaviruses in humans or domestic animals [16, 17] , it was hypothesized that the new virus might originate from wild animals. This hypothesis was supported by a search for coronaviruses in wild animals sold on markets in southern China, which identified the presence of a coronavirus in civet cats. This animal coronavirus was shown to have a sequence identity of more than 99% to the SARS coronavirus [18] with only a limited number of deletions and mutations between both viruses. SARSCoV has a deletion of 29 nucleotides relative to the civet cat virus, indicating that if there was direct transmission, it went from the animal to man, because deletions occur probably more easily than insertions. Recent reports indicate that SARSCoV is distinct from the civet cat virus and it has not been answered so far if the civet cat virus is the origin of the SARSCoV or if civet cats were also infected from other species [19] . Therefore, there are no data available on the possibility of horizontal transmission between animals, and the question whether the jump of the virus from an animal to humans was a single accident or may frequently occur in future with the animals as dangerous reservoirs for future SARS epidemics remains unanswered. So far, the SARSCoV has been reported to be able to infect not only humans but also macaque monkeys [11] , domestic cats, and ferrets [20] . However, transmission of the virus from the domestic cat to man has not been shown. The ability of the SARSCoV to infect other animal species could point to potential natural reservoirs of the virus. In this respect, coronaviruses are known to relatively easily jump to other species. I.e., the human coronavirus OC43 shares a high degree of genetic sequence homology to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and it is commonly assumed that it has jumped from one species to the other [21, 22] . In the same way, BCoV has been reported to be able to infect humans and cause diarrhea [23] .

In a largescale phylogenetic analysis of SARSCoV sequences [8] , a 5nucleotide motif at the GZ02 [GenBank :AY390556] reference nucleotide residues 17,564, 21,721, 22,222, 23,823, and 27,827 was identified to be most useful for distinguishing the major SARSCoV genotypes. These major viral genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic [8] . Thus, it is evident that viral sequence and molecular epidemiological data provide valuable information and tools for our combat against infectious diseases. However, direct sequencing of viral isolates from a large number of clinical samples is cumbersome and time consuming. Therefore, a rapid system for the characterization and screening of viral genotypes, such as for SARSCoV, would potentially be useful. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of the adoption of allelic discrimination assays based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes for the genotyping of SARSCoV isolates.", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus", "start": 142, "end": 159}]}]}, {"paper_id": "e36ee57eaf7546a475cd08d42c9192395f9b296e", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Members of the family Coronaviridae, within the order Nidovirales, are enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses. Several genera have been created for this order of viruses, including Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses, whose members infect mammals; and Gammacoronaviruses and Deltaoronaviruses, which affect both avian and mammalian species [1, 2] . Coronavirus infection usually causes a mild upper respiratory syndrome in humans, however, pathogens that are transmitted zoonotically can be highly pathogenic. This was seen with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20022003, which was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARSCoV) [3, 4] . It was demonstrated that SARSCoV was transmitted to humans from the market civet [5\uf02d7] . However, studies of farmed and wild civets did not support the theory that civets were the natural reservoirs of SARSCoV [7] [8] [9] . In 2005, two independent teams reported the discovery of SARSlike CoVs (SLCoVs) in bats and suggested that bats are natural reservoirs of SARSCoV [10, 11] . Since then, more genetically diverse SLCoVs have been found in China, Europe and Africa, suggesting a wide geographical distribution and an ancient origin for these viruses [12] [13] [14] [15] . The majority of bat SLCoVs were found in rhinolopus bats, particularly Rhinolophus sinicus, and display 87%92% nucleic acid identity and 93%100% amino acid similarity with SARSCoV [10,11,14\uf02d16] . However, those isolates found in Europe and Africa are distantly related to SARSCoV at a genomic level and possibly represent a new coronavirus species [12, 13, 16] . Unfortunately none of the above SLCoVs use the same receptor as SARSCoV, angiotensin converting enzyme II, to facilitate virus entry into a cell. This suggests that these SLCoVs are not direct progenitors of SARSCoV [17] . Phylogenetic analyses support the recombinant origin of a bat SLCoV coronavirus, and that R. sinicus may carry the director progenitor of SARSCoV [18] .

However, we are unable to resolve whether (a) The original batch of contaminated RPTEC were infected (naturally) with the virus prior to harvest, or (b) A worker with a respiratory infection accidentally contaminated the RPTEC during their initial preparation, or (c) The RPTEC were contaminated in our laboratory. We are unable to resolve the issue whether the cells were contaminated during preparation for many reasons, foremost being the company that sold the cells was merged with a different entity. It is unlikely that the RPTEC were infected in our laboratory, as we did not have HCoVNL63 in our laboratory in 2004, and acquired HCoVNL63  Amsterdam1 only recently (Sept. 2012) so that we could compare the biotype of HCoVNL63 RPTEC with that of Amsterdam1. Moreover, our laboratory policy dictates that workers refrain from cell culture work when they have a respiratory tract infection. It is plausible (but we lack proof) that HCoVNL63 may have been latent in the donor's kidneys, a possibility consistent with the known biology of various coronaviruses that establish longterm but subclinical infections. Noteworthy, SARSCoV, which shares the same ACE2 receptor as HCoVNL63, has been associated with kidney disease [61] [62] [63] [64] . SARSCoV causes a systemic infection with viral shedding not only in respiratory secretions, but also in stool and urine [63, 65, 66] . Perhaps HCoVNL63 is capable of causing systemic infections as well, though the severity is much less than that of SARSCoV. A parallel to this notion is the finding that HCoVNL63 replicates to high titers in CaCo2 cells [49] , which are derived from a human colon carcinoma.

Small animals such as palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procynonoides) sold in liveanimal wet markets in Guangdong Province of Southern China are believed to be the zoonotic source of the virus transmitted to humans [4] . In 2005, the complete sequences of SARSlike coronaviruses (SLCoVs) of genetic homology of 8792% to SARSCoV were identified from horseshoe bats of the genus Rhinolophus in China [5, 6] . However, these SLCoVs display significant differences in sequences at the receptorbinding domain (RBD) compared to SARSCoV and are unable to use the SARSCoV receptor, the human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for cellular entry [7] , rendering them unlikely to be the immediate progenitor of SARSCoV. More recently, a bat SLCoV capable of using the human ACE2 receptor for cellular entry was characterized and isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats, providing strong evidence that bats are the natural reservoirs of SARSCoV [8] .", "entities": [{"label": "Disease_COVID-19", "text": "novel coronavirus", "start": 196, "end": 213}]}]}, {"paper_id": "ead6fda7cdb2bb2469ff48365833bd63d0b7dd1a", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Since the emergence of the first cases in Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.717.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resourceintensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value.

There is a dearth of epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus, which would be of crucial importance to design and implement timely, ad hoc effective public health interventions, such as contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions. In this study, we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventions on infection. We found that the basic reproduction number could be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.717.23), which seems consistent with the special period prior to the Spring Festival when contacts were higher than usual, and with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least threefour generations. It is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 January 2020, as shown in Table 4 . Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to our model, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value. Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decisionand policymakers.

MERSCoV is enzootic in DC across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases.

However, MERSCoV has also been detected in mild and influenzalike illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities.
